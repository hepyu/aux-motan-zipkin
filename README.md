## zipkin ##
[Zipkin](http://zipkin.io) is a distributed tracing system. It helps gather timing data needed to troubleshoot latency problems in microservice architectures. It manages both the collection and lookup of this data. Zipkinâ€™s design is based on the [Google Dapper paper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html).

This project includes a dependency-free library and a [spring-boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) server. Storage options include in-memory, JDBC (mysql), Cassandra, and Elasticsearch.

Java Distributed Tracing implementation compatible with [Zipkin](http://zipkin.io).

Zipkin is based on [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html).

dapper (dutch) = brave (english)... so that's where the name comes from.

## Brave introduction ##

More information on Distributed Tracing and OpenZipkin here: <https://openzipkin.github.io>

You can use brave if you use the JVM and:

*   You can't use [Finagle](https://github.com/twitter/finagle).
*   You don't want to add Scala as a dependency to your Java project.
*   You want out of the box integration support for [RESTEasy](http://resteasy.jboss.org), [Jersey](https://jersey.java.net), [Apache HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.3.x/index.html).

Brave is compatible with OpenZipkin and its back-end components (zipkin-collector, zipkin-query, zipkin-web).
